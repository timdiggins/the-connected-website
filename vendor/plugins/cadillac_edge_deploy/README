CadillacEdgeDeploy
==================

Is your deployed rails application frozen to a particular revision?  If so, when a new version of rails is released how easy is it for you to upgrade?

Are you living on the edge of rails?  If so, how do you move to a more recent revision when you notice an enhancement you want to take advantage of?

Switching to a different version of rails should be easy.  

Mike Clark described a number of ways to manage your rails versions in this blog post:

http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/01/18#ManagingVersionsWithCap

Mike wrote of a "Cadillac Approach" in referring to Rick Olson's code that makes managing rails versions quite cinchy. 

This plugin is basically a rip-off of that blog post and Rick's code.  

I refactored things a bit primarily because I needed the approach to work even if Rails wasn't installed on the server I was deploying to.  I've also changed it since to work with git rather than svn.



Example
=======


To use the plugin, all you need to do is add the following to your deploy.rb:

set :rails_revision, '745359a49452da34978724144eaa318b8a363e08'


When you'd like the server to start using a different revision of rails, just adjust the rails_revision variable in your deploy.rb.
